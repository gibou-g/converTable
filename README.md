**converTable** is a python webapp hosted on `streamlit` to convert tabular data on images into a structured data tables.

The project seeks to help digitize record keeping in the Gambia. Most information in hospitals and offices (both government and private) is not stored digitally. The aim is to enable entities to have digital copies of data that will create ease of access for Data Scientists and Data practitioners.

It is currently developed and maintained by [Gibril](https://gibrilgaye.super.site) and [Modou Lamin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/modou-lamin-m-803212128/)
